Douban

-- requirement: text info in json format, raw images

-- First, as a human being, I decide to go through the procedure (do following steps on classroom computer)
	-- 1. ping the homepage of Douban
	-- 2. click and find top 250
	-- 3. 100 pages—— 25 films per page
	-- 4. each film has text info url and image info url
		-- open the text url and find the entire text
		-- download the image url directly
	-- 5. dump all the info and save the images

-- Therefore, we know how the procedure works(show the report)
	-- 1. home page -> find the top 250
	-- 2. top 250 -> find all the pages
	-- 3. pages -> find all the movies
	-- 4. movies -> find all the text info urls and image info urls
		-- for fear of anti-spider mechanism and avoid rebundant work, decide to save text and image urls, namely movie_urls and pic_urls respectively
	-- 5. text info -> open the text url, find all the text info and load by json
	-- 6. image info -> download directly according to the image url
	-- 7. save the required obejcts

-- implement the procedure(show the code)
